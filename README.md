# CNN-LSTM-network-architecture-for-geological-mapping-with-geochemical-exploration-data
Application of convolutional recurrent neural networks for geological feature mapping based on geochemical exploration data.
This python code use cross validation to tune the model and to find the optimal hyperparameters.
The input geochemical data include training and testing samples, where training samples are split into positive training data and negative training data, formatted as the example file.
The output result also formatted as a two dimensional matrix including the locations of samples and the corresponding probability of target geological feature occurrence.
